# Machine Learning Project: Classic Trader

The goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory study in which prices of
classic cars are estimated using machine learning methods.

## Data

The data for this analysis was scraped from the [classic trader](https://www.classic-trader.com/)
website, which describes itself as the international marketplace for classic
vehicles. After cleaning and preprocessing, about 8 thousand observations are
available for the analysis.

## Models

To estimate the car prices, following models were trained:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forrest
* K-nearest Neighbors
* Ensemble model(s) (averaging)

## Results

Unfortunately, the model cannot provide reliable prediction of the car prices.
Probable causes are data quantity, data quality, interaction effects and omitted
variable bias.

## About

This project was created as part of the last course of the [Professional Certificate
in Data Science by HarvardX via edx.org](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science?index=product&queryID=c3c7b56387e49eea61ef0a3406c52d37&position=1).
